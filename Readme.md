##Description
The Collatz Conjecture is a mathematical problem that is summarized as follows:
"Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process (which has been called "Half Or Triple Plus One", or HOTPO[7]) indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1." (Source: Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture, accessed January 6, 2016.)

The main question that remains is "...whether the sequence generated for every starting point *n* eventually reaches the value *n* = 1 and terminates." (Leslie Valiant, "Probably Approximately Correct", Basic Books, New York, 2013.) Each sequence will of course require a specified amount of time, *t*, to complete. Of course there are multiple ways of visualizing this data and it will be interesting to determine the best way of doing so and the resulting function. 

This program will run as long as possible and will document the time it takes to complete all iterations for each *n* value. Additionally, a version of this program may be written to count the number of steps per *n* value as a secondary output.
